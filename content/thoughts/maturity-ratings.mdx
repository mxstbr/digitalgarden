title: "Maturity Ratings"

Inspired by [@kurtkemple's tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/kurtkemple/status/1239720869561335810), each post in my [digital garden](/thoughts/digital-gardens) has a maturity rating attached to it:

ğŸŒ± means that the post is under development ("sprouting"), i.e. the presented thoughts/ideas are not fully formed and are subject to change.

ğŸŒº means that the post is developed ("bloomed"), i.e. the presented thoughts/ideas will not change dramatically.
