This iteration of my website is a "digital garden". Previous versions focused on being portfolios, which felt restricting to me. I want to be able to write about everything that is interesting to me on my website, not just polished articles about tech. When I stumbled upon [Joel Hooks' digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden), I knew that that is what I want my website to be.

Instead of presenting a chronological list of all my posts I curate a list of highlights for the homepage. This allows me to share work-in-progress thoughts without worrying about them being listed next to polished masterpieces[^None of my posts are actually masterpieces, but you know what I mean ðŸ˜…]. Every post has a [matury rating](/thoughts/maturity-ratings) attached to it which shows how developed it is.

If you want to read more about digital gardens or create your own, I recommend reading these posts:

- [How blogs broke the web](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/) by Amy Hoy for a philosophical overview over the problem with chronological lists of posts
- [Building a digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/) by Tom Critchlow for some of the more practical ideas behind building a digital gardcen

Here are some nice digital gardens from some of my favorite humans:
